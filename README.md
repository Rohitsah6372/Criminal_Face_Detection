## üîß Configuration

The application uses the following default configurations:

- **Database**: SQLite database stored in `instance/database.db`
- **Upload Folder**: `static/uploads/`
- **Secret Key**: Change `'your_secret_key_here'` in `app.py` for production
- **Face Recognition Tolerance**: 0.5 (adjustable in the code)

### Camera Feed Configuration

The system supports various camera types:

- **Local Device**: Use device indices (0, 1, 2...) for built-in or USB cameras
- **RTSP Stream**: Format: `rtsp://username:password@ip:port/stream`
- **IP Camera**: Format: `http://ip:port/video` or `https://ip:port/video`
- **CCTV System**: Format: `rtsp://admin:password@192.168.1.100:554/stream1`

Common RTSP URLs for popular camera brands:
- **Hikvision**: `rtsp://admin:password@ip:554/Streaming/Channels/101`
- **Dahua**: `rtsp://admin:password@ip:554/cam/realmonitor?channel=1&subtype=0`
- **Axis**: `rtsp://username:password@ip:554/axis-media/media.amp`

### Environment Variables

For production deployment, set these environment variables:

```bash
export SECRET_KEY="your-secure-secret-key"
export DATABASE_URL="sqlite:///path/to/database.db"
export FLASK_ENV="production"
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Considerations

- **File Upload Security**: Only image files (PNG, JPG, JPEG) are allowed
- **Secure Filenames**: Uploaded files are sanitized using `secure_filename()`
- **Database Security**: Face encodings are stored as binary data
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated before processing
- **Production Security**: Use environment variables for sensitive data
- **HTTPS**: Always use HTTPS in production environments

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **"Command not found: python"**
   - Use `python3` instead of `python`
   - Ensure virtual environment is activated

2. **Camera not working (WSL/Development)**
   - **WSL Users**: Camera access is limited in WSL. Use video upload or external camera feeds instead
   - **Development**: Check camera permissions in your browser
   - **Production**: Ensure camera drivers are properly installed
   - The system will show an error frame if no camera is available

3. **Face detection not working**
   - Ensure uploaded images contain clear, front-facing faces
   - Check lighting conditions for live detection
   - Verify face_recognition library is properly installed

4. **Camera feed connection issues**
   - Verify camera URL/credentials are correct
   - Test camera connection using the "Test Connection" button
   - Ensure camera is accessible from the network (for IP cameras)
   - Check firewall settings for RTSP streams

5. **Import errors**
   - Ensure all dependencies are installed: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - Activate virtual environment before running
   - Update setuptools: `pip install --upgrade setuptools`

6. **Development server warning**
   - This is normal for development. Use `gunicorn` for production
   - Install production requirements: `pip install -r requirements-prod.txt`

### Performance Tips:

- Use high-quality images for better face encoding
- Ensure good lighting for live detection
- Close unnecessary applications to free up system resources
- Use SSD storage for better database performance
- Monitor system resources during multi-camera operations

### WSL-Specific Issues:

- Camera access is limited in WSL environments
- Use video upload functionality instead of live camera
- External camera feeds (IP cameras, RTSP) work normally
- Consider using Windows native Python for camera access
